//https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/
//Given two words word1 and word2
//find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2
//dp[i][j]表示从word1前i个字符转换到word2前j个字符最少的步骤数
//在word1插入y， 那么dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1
//在word1删除x， 那么dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + 1
//把word1中的x用y来替换，那么dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
